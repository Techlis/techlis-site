                        <li>to provide technical support and respond to user inquiries</li>
                        <li>to prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Service</li>

                    </ol>
                    <p>One important use of your information is communication.

Some messages, such as invites for friends to join you in a app, may include your name and profile photo. We may also send promotional e-mail messages and promotional SMS messages (“Promotional Communications”) directly or in partnership with parties other than Techlis. Each Promotional Communication will generally offer recipients choices about receiving additional messages.</p>

                    <p>Our websites and apps may contain advertisements from companies other than Techlis that may link to their own websites.

                    <p>Techlis implements reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information both online and offline, and We are committed to the protection of customer information.</p>
                    <p>For user accounts registered directly with Techlis profile information is protected by the password each member uses to access their online account. It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify Us of any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your Techlis account, the website allows you to request that instructions be sent to you that explain how to reset your password. When you sign into your account or enter payment information (such as a credit card number when purchasing virtual currency), We encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (“SSL”).</p>
                    <p>While We take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our websites and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and We cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. If your SNS account is hacked, this may lead to unauthorized use of your Techlis apps, so be careful to keep your account information secure. If you have questions about the security of our websites, please contact Us at <a href="mailto:contact@techlis.com">contact@techlis.com</a>.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although We strive to protect your personal data, We cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once We have received your information, We have procedures and security features in place to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
